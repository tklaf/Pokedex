        <p>From the hit game series Pokémon, the Pokédex is a high-tech encyclopedia built into a handheld electronic device. This device allows you to find any
            Pokémon that has been discovered in any of the regions. Not only does this device show the Pokémon that are available, but it also shows you many
            of their statistics, including their height, weight, base stats (meaning their attack, defense, etc.), and even their moves! The Pokédex is one of the
            most vital tools for any serious Pokémon trainer.
